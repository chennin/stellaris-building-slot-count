[h1]About[/h1]
This mod displays your currently-built building count on the planet view, and details where the building slots are coming from on the tooltip.

Useful for example for knowing how many city districts you are wasting after you've researched some techs or taken some traditions.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Not achievement compatible.

Not compatible with any other mod that changes the planet view (planet_view.gui). I have compatibility mods, use [b]only one[/b]:

[h1]Localisation[/h1]
Everything is localised using VANILLA strings, so it should be close, but I only speak English and it might sound weird in places.

[h1]Modder Info[/h1]
The mod takes planet_view.gui and makes only two additions: some variables, and an effectButtonType named fl_planet_num_buildings.  As part of my automation it does re-flow the file using [url=https://github.com/kuyan-judith/Diagraphers-Stellaris-Mods]this[/url].

[h1]Notes[/h1]
Source code is on [url=https://github.com/chennin/stellaris-building-slot-count]GitHub[/url].

The tooltip will not display most modifiers that are zero, but to test everything out you can select a planet then paste this in the console: [code]effect custom_tooltip = $fl_num_building_long_static$[/code]
